## Description

![](assets/images/Mockup.jpg) ADD A DIFFERENT IMAGE

MovieTracker is an app that allows users to organise their movie watching.  ADD MORE TO THIS? 

MOTIVATION: 
The motivation for our project was a combination of passion and real-world problem. 

Passion: We love watching movies.

‚ÄãProblem: We struggled to organise our movie watching. 

We wanted to create an app that would make movie nights easy peasy and answer the age-old question "What have I seen that actor in before?"

We created this app so that movie lovers could check out which films are trending at the moment, search for movies by title, add movies to a watchlist, see how many stars it has, read the movie summary, watch the trailer, check out who the main actors are, and find out information about actors.‚Äã

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?

## User Story 
We used the following User Story to define the goals and requirements of this project: 

AS A movie fanatic‚Äã

I WANT to be able to see which films are trending right now, search for movies by title, watch the trailer, see how many stars it has, read the movie summary, check out who the main actors are, find out information about actors, and add movies to a watchlist.‚Äã

SO THAT I can organize my movie watching
