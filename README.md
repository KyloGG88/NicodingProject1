## Description
Movie Tracker is a comprehensive and user-friendly movie searching website that caters to both casual moviegoers and avid cinephiles.

***Key Features:***
* Movie Search: search for movies by title,modal popup when movie poster is clicked, trailer embedded in modal
* Actor Search: actor's profile: a short overview, theirpicture and 3 highest rated movies
* Watchlist Feature: users to create and manage a personalized watchlist
* User-Friendly Interface: clean and intuitive design,responsive search bar and easy to find watchlist button

## Motivation 
The motivation for our project was a combination of passion and real-world problem. 

* Passion: We love watching movies.
* ​Problem: We struggled to organise our movie watching. 
* We wanted to create an app that would make movie nights easy peasy and answer the age-old question "What have I seen that actor in before?"

We created this app so that movie lovers could check out which films are trending at the moment, search for movies by title, add movies to a watchlist, see how many stars it has, read the movie summary, watch the trailer, check out who the main actors are, and find out information about actors.​

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
